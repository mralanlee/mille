# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the technical specifications for a Terraform/OpenTofu plan visualization tool designed to help non-DevOps personnel understand infrastructure changes before they are applied. The tool provides a visual representation of Terraform plan outputs, highlighting resource creations, modifications, and deletions in an intuitive manner.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
Non-DevOps or SRE professionals often struggle to interpret Terraform plan outputs, especially in complex environments using modules with abstract inputs. This lack of understanding can lead to unintended infrastructure modifications or destructions. As organizations grow and leverage more abstract Terraform modules, this problem becomes more pronounced.

## 1.3 Solution Overview
A tool that transforms Terraform/OpenTofu plan outputs into visual diagrams, representing resources and their relationships, with clear visual indicators for different types of changes (create, update, destroy, recreate). The tool will support both CLI usage and web-based visualization, with CI/CD integration capabilities.
