# 11. Technical Decisions and Rationale

## 11.1 Backend Technology

**Selected**: Go + Python hybrid

**Rationale**:
- Go provides excellent performance for plan parsing and graph processing
- Python's Diagrams library is purpose-built for infrastructure visualization
- Native support for cloud provider icons (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- The hybrid approach combines the strengths of both languages
- PyOxidizer allows packaging as a single binary

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure Go: Would provide better performance but lacks equivalent visualization libraries
- Pure Python: Easier visualization but slower performance for large plans
- Rust + Python: Potentially better performance but higher development complexity

## 11.2 Frontend Technology

**Selected**: Svelte with D3.js

**Rationale**:
- Svelte provides excellent performance with minimal runtime overhead
- Compiled approach results in smaller bundle sizes
- D3.js offers complete control over visualization details
- Strong community and extensive examples for D3.js
- Reactive programming model works well with visualization updates
- Good performance for large graphs with appropriate optimizations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React + Cytoscape.js: More widespread but higher runtime overhead
- Svelte + Cytoscape.js: Good alternative if D3.js customization proves challenging
- Various other frameworks (Next.js, Astro, SolidJS)

## 11.3 Web Server Technology

**Selected**: Flask or FastAPI (Python)

**Rationale**:
- Consistency with Python backend
- Simple API implementation
- Good performance for webhook handling
- Easy deployment options
- Extensive documentation and examples
