# 12. System Scaling

## 12.1 Backend Processing Strategies

### Queue-Based Processing
- Implement asynchronous processing for webhook requests
- Use a task queue to manage incoming plan processing requests
- Process plans asynchronously rather than synchronously in the request handler
- Prioritize smaller plans when possible to maintain responsiveness

### Worker Pool Architecture
- Deploy multiple worker processes to handle plan processing
- Calculate optimal worker count based on server resources
- Each worker handles one plan at a time
- Resource limiting to prevent system overload

### Resource Calculations
For a scenario with 10 active PRs, each with 3,000 resource changes:

- **Memory Usage per Plan**: ~30-50MB per plan
- **Processing Time per Plan**: ~12-22 seconds on a standard server
- **Concurrent Load**: 300-500MB total memory requirement for 10 plans
- **Required Workers**: 2-3 workers for processing 10 plans within a 5-minute window

### Performance Optimization
- Chunked processing for large plans
- Parallelization across multiple cores
- Memory optimization with streaming processing
- Circuit breakers to prevent system overload

## 12.2 Graph Visualization Scaling Techniques

- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Group resources by module, service, or logical component
- **Level-of-Detail Rendering**: Simplify visualization based on zoom level
- **Progressive Loading**: Load and render portions of the graph as needed
- **Resource Filtering**: Allow users to focus on specific resource types or changes

## 12.3 Caching Strategy

### File-Based Caching (CLI Tool)
- Store cache in user's cache directory (e.g., `~/.cache/mille/`)
- Use simple file structure with hashed keys as filenames
- Cache parsed plans, module layouts, and rendered images
- Implement size management and cleanup utilities

### Optional Redis Caching (Web Server)
- Use Redis for the web server component (future milestone)
- Share cache across multiple instances
- Implement complex data structures for different cache types
- Enable horizontal scaling and better memory management

### Cache Invalidation
- Smart invalidation based on plan changes
- Version tagging for compatibility
- Time-based expiration for older cache entries
